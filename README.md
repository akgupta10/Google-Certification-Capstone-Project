# Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?
## Cyclistic Bike-Share Riders Analysis

### Summary
I am wearing the hat of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at **Cyclistic** (fictitious name), a bike-share company in Chicago. Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Purpose 
The purpose of analysis is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  The insights gained from this study will help to understand the behaviour and usage pattern of different category of customers. This will lead to creation of a focused marketing campaign based on these findings to convert casual riders into annual members. The study will analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data of last one year to identify trends. 

### Data Sources
Cyclistic’s historical [trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (last 12 months). The data is usable and is in .csv format. It has clean dates and times, with no outliers. It is relevant to the presented problem. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under [this](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) license. This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
